          I am Allan M. Balanga Jr., a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, where I maintained a spot on the Deanâ€™s List from 2020 to 2023. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in technical concepts and problem-solving skills.

          I worked as an AI Talkbot Support at WIZ Holdings, where I collaborated with a team of developers to design and implement a talkbot. In this role, I focused on constructing user responses and assisted with annotations and testings for automatic speech recognition and text-to-speech functionalities of the talkbot.

          I am also a person who is eager to explore and learn new things, especially when it comes to technology. For example, even as I focus on job hunting, I have enrolled in a programming course to expand my technical skills and relearn things from my earlier years as a student.
